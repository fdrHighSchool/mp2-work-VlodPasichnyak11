# Div By 3
#### Respond to the following:

1. A number is considered *prime* if its only factors are 1 and itself. For example, 7 is prime (1 and 7 are the only factors) and 9 is not (1, 3 and 9 are factors).  
Outline an algorithm to determine whether or not a number is prime.  
Think of the following method header:
`public static boolean isPrime(int num)`

  * List Numbers from 1 to num. (For Loop)
  * if num is divisible by 2 to num - 1; return TRUE, else return FALSE;
  * Immediately Stop the Loop if a Factor is Found.
